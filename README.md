# [madefor.cc]

Provides vanity domains for ComputerCraft-related projects. This allows people to create their own websites, and use
a `x.madefor.cc` domain.

## Examples

- [plethora.madefor.cc](https://plethora.madefor.cc "Plethora's documentation")
- [metis.madefor.cc](https://metis.madefor.cc "metis's documentation")

## Getting started

- Create your website! The easiest way to do this is through [GitHub pages][pages], but any hosting provider will work.
   If you want something more powerful, you might want to check out [Netlify] or [Vercel].
- Choose a subdomain (and check it's available). This will probably be the name of your project but you might want
   something else.
- Set up your hosting provider with your subdomain. On GitHub, it's as simple as [creating a `CNAME` file][cname].
- Add your subdomain and existing domain (for instance `me.github.io` or `whatever.netlify.app`) to the
   `dns/domains.py` file, and send us a pull request!
