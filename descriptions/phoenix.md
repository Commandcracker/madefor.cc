Phoenix is the next-generation modular operating system for ComputerCraft. It introduces a brand-new way to interact with CC, adding many services from modern systems such as preemptive multitasking, filesystem permissions, virtual device trees, and much more. Phoenix entirely replaces CraftOS, giving programs a clean slate free from the legacy APIs and odd syntaxes that plague CraftOS, while still providing the same ease of use as CraftOS&#8217;s APIs. In addition, it includes a graphical user interface with support for rich applications, allowing a full desktop OS experience inside ComputerCraft.
